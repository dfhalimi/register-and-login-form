### Register and Login Form

![Alt register-form](./img/register-form.PNG?raw=true "register-form")

You can set your username, email address (just use a fake one) and password
in the register form and use the information in the login form.

UI design was from goolge images, but I can't find the original image anymore.
Please let me know, if you happen to know who came up with the design so I can credit that person.
